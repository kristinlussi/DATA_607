Project Proposal Overview:

Our project aims to identify the residential and commercial structures with the highest flood risk in New York City. We will develop a ranking system, find those areas based on risk level, and prioritize the most risky buildings for analysis. We envisage the final product of our work as a direct marketing tool for the insurance industry.

Data Sources: 
The source of our projectâ€™s risk data is the City of New York's environment floodplain dataset.  We may use ChatGPT to tag the data. We will create a machine-learning algorithm to process the data. The Google Maps API is an excellent candidate to produce a visualization of the resultant set of structures with the highest flood risk in New York City. 

Possible additional areas of study:
If time permits, we will use the following datasets to extend our project:
Study the relationship between water quality and flood risk
Study the relationship between poverty and flood risk
Study the relationship between construction materials and flood damage
